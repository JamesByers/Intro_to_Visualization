 ##### Visualization overview
 
#### Code-along
  * Download the Pronto Bike Share dataset
    * [Web Location](https://www.kaggle.com/pronto/cycle-share-dataset)
      * Note this data set on Kaggle has some data quality issues that are eliminated in the class repository version
    * [In our class repository](https://github.com/JamesByers/Intro_to_Visualization/tree/master/Seattle_pet_license_data)
  * Get aquainted with the worksheet functions
  * Connect to a file in Tableau
  * Create a simple chart
 
#### Exercise: Create your first chart using the Seattle Pet License data**  
* The Seattle Pet License dataset
    * [Web link](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Seattle-Pet-Licenses/jguv-t9rb)
    * [In our class repository](https://github.com/JamesByers/Intro_to_Visualization/tree/master/Pronto_bike_share_visualization/cycle-
* Create a line chart with License Day on the x axis (horizontal axis) and count of License Numbers on the y axis (vertical access)
* Duplicate worksheet and modify to be a line chart with Month on the x axis
* Modify to be a bar chart
* Duplicate the worksheet and modify so that the chart shows the count of the licenses by month for all years
  
#### Code along #2
* Create simple calculated fields
* Work with multiple measures
* Add filters

#### Exercise with Elliot Bay Trail data**
  * Use calculated fields to create a chart of pedestrians vs. bikes by summing the pedestrian counts and the bike counts
    * use dual axis to create chart comparing the two over time
  * Create a new chart using the "Measure Names and filters to create a chart comparing all four entrance counts over time
  
* **Code along - Create Dashboards**
* **Exercise: Create dashboards with Pronto Bike share data**
